# DesignPatterns
## design patterns in Net7.0

I watch [Mosh Hamedani](https://github.com/mosh-hamedani) Design Patterns Video and for practice i decided to create this Repository.

#### What is Design Pattern:

Design patterns provide general solutions or a flexible way to solve common design problems. This article provides an introduction of design patterns and how design patterns are implemented in C# and .NET.

## Technologies

ASP.NET Core 7

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to install the NuGet package and run dotnet new ca-sln:

1. Install the latest .NET 7 SDK
2. Run dotnet new ca-sln to create a new project
3. Navigate to src/DesignPattern and launch the project using dotnet run

## Overview

#### Memento

The Memento design pattern without violating encapsulation, captures and externalizes an objectâ€˜s internal state so that the object can be restored to this state late.

#### State

The State design pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

#### Iterator

The Iterator design pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

#### Strategy

The Strategy design pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
